# Radiomic Analysis of colorectal liver metastasis

This project was developed with CT scan images patients who underwent a surgery for treatment of colorectal liver metastasis. Among these patients majority of them had multiple tumors. My data includes CT scans with corresponding clinical data which contain follow up and survival information of patients.
								When dealing with multiple tumors, there is a need of aggregating the radiomic features from all tumors present in one patients. My goal was to aggregate the radiomic features in patients with multiple tumors in mathematical methods and compare them to found out better performing method.
